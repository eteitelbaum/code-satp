0,NA,"A CPI-Maoist manual that has helped Maoists accelerate their activities in Gadchiroli has been recovered. After a subdued stint in Gadchiroli, the Maoists have resolved to recapture their turf in the eastern District of Maharashtra. Inducting new militia, modernisng weaponry and much more is the new Maoist strategy to carry out red terror in Gadchiroli. The manual is prepared by Kosa alias Satynarayana Rao, 'secretary' of the Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) militant wing. This report, prepared late 2008, is an analysis of the Maoists decline in Gadchiroli. A future strategy, that's found resonance in attacks this year, including the gruesome encounter in Laheri that killed 17 Policemen is mentioned in the report. The report also states reasons for an unsuccessful Maoist stint in Gadchiroli since 2003. According to Kosa's observations in the report, Gadchiroli has eluded Maoist attacks due to inadequate recruitment. The recommendations of the manual have now been taken very seriously. Three major attacks this year alone have massacred around 50 Policemen. Kosa's recommendations include, militia induction drives, classes for women in Upper Bastar based on new syllabus, formation of another revolutionary cell of locals and change from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare. The Union Government's anti-Maoist operation 'Operation Green Hunt' is in its first stage. And Gadchiroli forms the first phase of this operation. Given this, Kosa's analysis could help the forces to beat the Maoists to their own game."

The area dalams have received training in deep forest camps with the active support of the villagers on the either side of the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. Apart from the other routine work of recruitment and intelligence gathering, these area dalam members have been specially trained in planting explosives and triggering blasts.
